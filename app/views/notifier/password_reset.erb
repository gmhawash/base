Hello, <%= @user.name %>,

We received a request to reset your password on <%= @host %>.  If this was
your intention, please click the following link, or copy and paste the link to
your browser's URL bar.  If you successfully log in before resetting your
password, this link will no longer succeed.

http://<%= @host %>/account/reset_password/<%= @user.activation_code %>

This link will expire one week after the request was made. 

If you did not initiate this request, someone has mistakenly entered a password
reset request for your account.

Thanks,
Council on State Governments
